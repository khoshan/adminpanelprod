Soldier_GOBLIN    =    These pesky little creatures only have eyes for one thing: LOOT! They are faster than a Quick Sand, and their hunger for resources is limitless.

Chapter01_text_000   =   Once upon a time, in the vast Arabian desert, there was a young child named...
Chapter01_text_001   =   ...%username%
Tutorial_text_000   =   After travelling for many days across harsh dunes and rocky hills, we have finally arrived at my tribe's coastal village.
Tutorial_text_001   =   It is called...
Tutorial_text_002   =   ...%villagename%
Tutorial_text_003   =   These people were always loyal to your father, and will help with whatever you need...
Tutorial_text_004   =   Why don't I show you around? It might help take your mind off your troubles...
Tutorial_text_005   =   Hm. It seems things have gotten worse here since I left, so many years ago...
Tutorial_text_006   =   The village is vulnerable to attacks from more powerfull tribes, who threaten our meager supply of GOLD and WATER...
Tutorial_text_007   =   If we want to protect ourselves, we must build DEFENSES and an ARMY. And for that we'll need RESOURCES.
Tutorial_text_008   =   We already have a TREASURY, where merchants trade and collect gold...
Tutorial_text_009   =   ... and a GOLD CHEST to store the gold...
Tutorial_text_010   =   And a WATER JUG with some water in it...
Tutorial_text_011   =   ... but our WELL has dried up! That won't do at all, we must build a new one.
Tutorial_text_012   =   Allow me to introduce our trusty village CARPENTER.
Tutorial_text_013   =   Carpenters build new buildings, and upgrade existing ones.
Tutorial_text_014   =   Let's but this one to work, shall we? No sense wasting time!
Tutorial_text_015   =   Good! Now at least we won't die of thirst... I hope.
Tutorial_text_016   =   You can speed up carpenters' work or recruit new ones by spending PEARLS.
Tutorial_text_017   =   Great! Now we sould build some defenses- thirst can kill you, but a sword does the job even faster!
Tutorial_text_018   =   You can wait for your carpenters to be free, or spend pearls to finish what they're doing and start a new job.
Tutorial_text_019   =   Right now we have pearls to spare- keep it moving!
Tutorial_text_020   =   Excellent. Always be sure our defenses cover as much of the village as possible!
Tutorial_text_021   =   Looks like we were just in time: a search party from the Black Army is headed this way!
Tutorial_text_022   =   We have followed you across the desert for weeks. Our orders were to leave no one alive...
Tutorial_text_023   =   Prepare to meet you fate!
Tutorial_text_024   =   Yeesh, we barely pulled through! If there were any more of them, we'd have lost for sure...
Tutorial_text_025   =   Once we've stored up more gold, it would be wise to upgrade and build more defenses.
Tutorial_text_026   =   Now to the final step: raising an army!
Tutorial_text_027   =   We need TRAINING GROUNDS, where troops are recruited and trained, and TENTS for them to live in.
Tutorial_text_028   =   At training grounds, you can recruit different units.
Tutorial_text_029   =   And you should do so without delay: one of the villagers came across a small Black Army outpost nearby!
Tutorial_text_030   =   If we don't do something, they'll tell The Butcher where we are...
Tutorial_text_031   =   ...but if I quickly train ten men, we can attack them first and keep our village safe!
Tutorial_text_032   =   Let me show you how to raise an army...
Tutorial_text_033   =   The men are ready, %username%. You have the honor of sending them out!
Tutorial_text_034   =   %username%, the men have returned!
Tutorial_text_035   =   What's more, they raided the outpost's resources - now we have enough gold to upgrade the Main Tent!
Tutorial_text_036   =   Upgrading the Main Tent allows us to build even more defenses and resource buildings...
Tutorial_text_037   =   Congratulations are in order. %villagename% is growing...
Tutorial_text_038   =   We survived our first attack, and made sure The Butcher won't know about us for some time.
Tutorial_text_039   =   I know your heart still burns with pain at the loss of your family...
Tutorial_text_040   =   Someday, we may grow strong enough to go after The Butcher... but for now, we face many other threats.
Tutorial_text_041   =   We live in a harsh environment, with dwindling resources. A land where warring tribes constantly raid each other - and us too, if we don't build up our strength.
Tutorial_text_042   =   For now, %username%, we must fight to survive...
Tutorial_text_043   =   Ten years slipped past like grains of sand...
Tutorial_text_044   =   Gone was the frightened young child, forced to witness his village burn at the hands of a general called The Butcher.
Tutorial_text_045   =   Under the wisdom of his teacher Abu Saleh, %username% learned all he could about training and commanding an army, about the different tribes in the region, and about the powerful Empire to the north - home of the Butcher and his Black Army...
Tutorial_text_046   =   The Butcher has a secret base, deep in the desert, from where he launches all his raids. They say no one who finds it comes back alive...
Tutorial_text_047   =   %username%, our spies followed the Colonials back to their fort...
Tutorial_text_048   =   And saw the Commander meeting with soldiers from the Black Army!
Tutorial_text_049   =   The shameless opportunist is selling to both sides!
Tutorial_text_050   =   If we attack the Colonial Commander, we can learn the location of the Butcher’s hideout AND cut off his weapon supply.
Tutorial_text_051   =   Just give the word, and we will attack the Colonial Commander and continue your quest for justice... 
Tutorial_text_052   =   Train your army, and send them out when you’re ready!
Tutorial_text_053   =   You! What is the meaning of this?
Tutorial_text_054   =   We sniffed you out, you snake!
Tutorial_text_055   =   You’re selling arms to the Butcher - the man who killed my family!
Tutorial_text_056   =   Time to get what’s coming to you.
Tutorial_text_057   =   Hah! Our guns will crush your pathetic excuse for an army!
Tutorial_text_058   =   Oh no! We need to upgrade our troops and Staging Area, so we can send a more powerful army!
Tutorial_text_059   =   %username%, we've captured the Colonial Commander!
Tutorial_text_060   =   The scoundrel thought he could get away with selling guns to the man who killed your family...
Tutorial_text_061   =   Shall we see what he has to say for himself?
Tutorial_text_062   =   %username%, if you want to gain new allies to help with raids and protecting %villagename%, you must either join a Tribe or start one of your own.
Tutorial_text_063   =   But our Majlis is old and rundown.
Tutorial_text_064   =   There’s no place in the Village suitable to host other Tribesmen!
Tutorial_text_065   =   That simply will not do. What will people say about us?
Tutorial_text_066   =   Before you can join or create a Tribe, we must repair the Majlis, so we can host in style!
Tutorial_text_067   =   Of course it's your decision when to fix it, but I say the sooner the better...

Help_Info_1   =   Once placed on the battlefield, your troops are autonomous and cannot be controlled once they are deployed. At the moment of deployment, each unit's first target is highlighted with crosshairs. Difference units will attack according to their abilities and their preferred targets. Check each unit's info in the Training Grounds' Train Troops screen. and check difference defensive turrets' info as well to learn which units they target.
Help_Info_2   =   After combat, all troops deployed on battlefield turn back into water and soak into the earth.\n\nExpending troops to win battles is at the heart of strategy in Bedouin Battle. Think of your troops as resources to be spent wisely. You should plan every battle carefully and try to use the right number of the right type of troops. Throwing all your troops to combat without considering the cost versus benefit can lead to a Pyrrhic victory, where you end up spending more resources than you gained.
Help_Info_3   =   The shield prevents other people from attacking you for a period of time. You lose the shield when the time runs out, or when you attack another player. When your village is destroyed by an enemy attack, you automatically get a new shield for 12 hours. You can also purchase longer lasting shields from the store.
Help_Info_4   =   While most of transactions go smoothly, sometimes an answer from the payment provider or our server might be slower than usual or might result in errors. Please wait some time and see if they will arrive. If this doesn't help, quit and restart the game. Your pearl should be credited to you.\n\nIf this doesn't help, please contact our customer support at lumba_feedback@gmail.com and our support will help you as soon as possible.
