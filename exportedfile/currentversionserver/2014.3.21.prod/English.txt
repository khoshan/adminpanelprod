Help_Info_2 = After combat, all troops deployed on battlefield turn back into water and soak into the earth.\n\nExpending troops to win battles is at the heart of strategy in Tribal Rivals. Think of your troops as resources to be spent wisely. You should plan every battle carefully and try to use the right number of the right type of troops. Throwing all your troops to combat without considering the cost versus benefit can lead to a Pyrrhic victory, where you end up spending more resources than you gained.
Help_Info_3 = The armor prevents other people from attacking you for a period of time. You lose the armor when the time runs out, or when you attack another player. When your village is destroyed by an enemy attack, you automatically get a new armor for 12 hours. You can also purchase longer lasting armors from the souq.
Help_Info_4 = While most of transactions go smoothly, sometimes an answer from the payment provider or our server might be slower than usual or might result in errors. Please wait some time and see if they will arrive. If this doesn't help, quit and restart the game. Your pearl should be credited to you.\n\nIf this doesn't help, please contact our customer support at tr-support+purchasing@lum.ba and our support will help you as soon as possible.
Help_Info_1 = Once placed on the battlefield, your troops are autonomous and cannot be controlled once they are deployed. At the moment of deployment, each unit's first target is highlighted with crosshairs. Difference units will attack according to their abilities and their preferred targets. Check each unit's info in the Training Grounds' Train Troops screen. and check difference defensive turrets' info as well to learn which units they target.

Comic1_00 = Once upon a time, in the vast Arabian desert, there was a young child named Faris...
Comic1_01_01 = Hya! Yaah! Attack!
Comic1_01_02a = Hya! Forward!
Comic1_01_02b = Faris was the only child of the leader of a small but happy tribe. They didn't have much, but life was peaceful and they were respected by the other Bedouin families.
Comic1_01_03a = Faris's teacher Abu Saqer was a wise and tough fighter who suffered grave injuries in battle. He saw something special in Faris from a young age, and made it his life's mission to teach him the ways of the Bedouin...
Comic1_01_03b = Someday I'll be a great warrior, just like my father.
Comic1_01_03c = Your father is head of this tribe not just because he's a great warrior, but because he's a wise leader...
Comic1_02a = Those people down there aren't warriors, young Faris.
Comic1_02b = They're just people...trying to keep their camels fed and do right by their families.
Comic1_03_01 = They respect your father because he makes that possible.
Comic1_03_02 = And because he's a great warrior.
Comic1_03_03 = Haha! Well, there may be some truth to that...
Comic1_04_01a = Then again, your father used to pay attention during his lessons. Come on, back to work...
Comic1_04_01b = ...wait.
Comic1_04_02a = Abu Saqer? What...who is that?
Comic1_04_02b = Dear God no...
Comic1_04_03a = No!
Comic1_04_03b = I don't understand, who are they?
Comic1_04_04a = We have to run.
Comic1_04_04b = Run? A warrior doesn't run-
Comic1_04_05 = Enough of that, there's no choice!
Comic1_05_01 = But my family?
Comic1_05_02 = It's too late, child...
Comic1_06 = ...the BLACK ARMY has found us.
Comic1_07_01 = NO! Father! Mother!
Comic1_07_02 = We must go. I'm sorry...
Comic1_07_03 = ...there's nothing we can do for them.
Comic1_08a = The Black Army hails from a grand city far to the north, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Comic1_08b = They roam these lands, taking what they want in the Faris of their Empire...
Comic1_09 = Their leader is known as THE BUTCHER, a ruthless general with a heart black as coal...
Comic1_10a = ...who destroys anything that gets in his way.
Comic1_10b = Come child, let's escape while we still can...
Comic1_11 = ...you don't want to see what happens next.
Comic4a = Ten years slipped past like grains of sand...
Comic4b = Gone was the frightened young child, forced to witness his village burn at the hands of a general called The Butcher.
Comic4c = Under the wisdom of Abu Saqer, Faris learned all he could about training and commanding an army, the different tribes in the region, and the powerful Empire to the north - home of the Butcher and his Black Army...
Comic4_12 = Faris grew into a brash and proud young man, already considered a great leader by the people of The VILLAGE.
Comic4_13 = He had led many raids against other tribes, and defended against many more. The village grew stronger each day...
Comic4_14 = ...but Faris remained unsatisfied. Thoughts bent on revenge for the loss of his family.
Comic4_15_01 = Sir!
Comic4_15_02 = Sorry to interrupt, sir. Your guest, the COLONIAL COLONEL, has arrived.
Comic4_15_03 = Gentlemen, a pleasure. I've travel here from distant lands, and have been looking forward to this meeting.
Comic4_16_01 = We welcome you - but there have been troubling rumors...
Comic4_16_02 = About Colonial soldiers like yours, from distant lands, setting up forts all along the coast...
Comic4_16_03 = And from what I hear, you've brought powerful new weapons and defenses...
Comic4_17_01 = ...almost as if you were up to no good...
Comic4_17_02 = Surely, you're joking. I'm here to help you fight the Empire that oppresses you!
Comic4_17_03 = I ensure you, we are very serious.
Comic4_18_01 = I know firsthand the kind of damage your weapons can do...
Comic4_18_02 = ...they're the same weapons the Black Army used against my family.
Comic4_19_01a = What do you know about The Butcher? How did he get those weapons?
Comic4_19_01b = The Butcher's reach is far and wide. But I can help you fight back.
Comic4_19_01c = You would give us weapons?
Comic4_19_01d = For a small price. We supply weapons, you supply goods and resources...and convince other tribes to work with us.
Comic4_19_01e = If you prove trustworthy, I'll even share some information that you might find quite valuable...
Comic4_19_02 = The Butcher has a secret base, deep in the desert, from where he launches all his raids. They say no one who finds it comes back alive...
Comic4_20_01a = People say many things...
Comic4_20_01b = A wise man once told me that nothing is impossible...
Comic4_20_02a = ...if you have the right strategy.
Comic4_20_02b = We're done fighting for survival, Abu Saqer...
Comic4_21 = ...it's time I had revenge against the Butcher.
Comic6_22 = This is an outrage!
Comic6_23_01a = You attack my fort, capture my men, steal our weapons!
Comic6_23_01b = Who do you think you are!?
Comic6_23_02a = You double-crossed us.
Comic6_23_02b = You said you came to help us against the Butcher, but you got greedy.
Comic6_23_03 = Now you're going to tell me everything you know about The Butcher and his Black Army...
Comic6_23_04 = ...or else.
Comic6_24_01a = No need for threats- we'll make a new deal. His location in exchange for my life.
Comic6_24_01b = You're in no position to negotiate, old man.
Comic6_24_01c = And you, young man, have much to learn about the world...very well.
Comic6_24_02 = Here. Deep in the heart of the Empty Quarter.
Comic6_25_01 = There's nothing there for you but death!

Comic9_35_02c = Me? Oh, I'm not the one in charge here...
Comic9_36_01a = ...he is.
Comic9_36_01b = You? I have grandchildren older than you!
Comic9_36_01c = My name is Faris.
Comic9_36_02 = Why have you done this?

Comic9_45b = But you now face a hard choice.
Comic9_46_01 = A decision only you can make.
Comic9_46_02 = Whether this villain should die, as you've struggled and fought for, and as he no doubt deserves...
Comic9_46_03 = Or whether you will show mercy and let him live, his own miserable existence being punishment enough...
Comic9_47a = The choice is yours, Faris, and yours alone...
Comic9_47b = Very well. I've made my decision...
Comic9_48_01 = 
Comic9_48_02a = I am nothing like you... But I can't allow a monster like you to live and threaten others.
Comic9_48_02b = I will spend the rest of my life fighting to make sure that men like you never rule.
Comic9_48_02c = Come, Abu Saqer...
Comic9_48_03 = ...There is still much work to be done.
Comic9_49_01a = He will be stripped of all his possessions...
Comic9_49_01b = Wait! What is this?
Comic9_49_01c = You can't do this!
Comic9_49_02a = And set out alone into the Empty Quarter...
Comic9_49_02b = If he survives, it will only be because some passing soul took pity on him.
Comic9_49_02c = If not, he will get what he deserves...
Comic9_49_03a = And what about us?
Comic9_49_03b = Well... There are others like him...
Comic9_49_03c = More Colonials arriving all the time...
Comic9_49_03d = Hostile tribes all around...
Comic9_49_03e = ...I'm sure we'll find something to keep us busy. Trust me - this is just the beginning...
