Tutorial_text_006 = The village is vulnerable to attacks from more powerfull tribes, who threaten our meager supply of GOLD and WATER...
Tutorial_text_007 = If we want to protect ourselves, we must build DEFENSES and an ARMY. And for that we'll need RESOURCES.

Help_Info_1 = Once placed on the battlefield, your troops are autonomous and cannot be controlled once they are deployed. At the moment of deployment, each unit's first target is highlighted with crosshairs. Difference units will attack according to their abilities and their preferred targets. Check each unit's info in the Training Grounds' Train Troops screen. and check difference defensive turrets' info as well to learn which units they target.
Help_Info_2 = After combat, all troops deployed on battlefield turn back into water and soak into the earth.\n\nExpending troops to win battles is at the heart of strategy in Bedouin Battle. Think of your troops as resources to be spent wisely. You should plan every battle carefully and try to use the right number of the right type of troops. Throwing all your troops to combat without considering the cost versus benefit can lead to a Pyrrhic victory, where you end up spending more resources than you gained.
Help_Info_3 = The armor prevents other people from attacking you for a period of time. You lose the armor when the time runs out, or when you attack another player. When your village is destroyed by an enemy attack, you automatically get a new armor for 12 hours. You can also purchase longer lasting armors from the store.
Help_Info_4 = While most of transactions go smoothly, sometimes an answer from the payment provider or our server might be slower than usual or might result in errors. Please wait some time and see if they will arrive. If this doesn't help, quit and restart the game. Your pearl should be credited to you.\n\nIf this doesn't help, please contact our customer support at lumba_feedback@gmail.com and our support will help you as soon as possible.
